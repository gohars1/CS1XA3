# README for Project02 <h1> Sources <h2>
For the Design, and Button functionality of my webpage I used the following  template: 
https://startbootstrap.com/themes/stylish-portfolio/  For the Design of the Resume portion of my webpage 
I used the following template: http://www.thomashardy.me.uk/free-responsive-html-css3-cv-template 
# Tools for Webpage <h2>
For the Website I used HTML, CSS and Javascript. The majority of what I edited in the above templates 
were HTML and CSS.\ The Javascript was provided by the template I referenced above "stylish-portfolio". \ 
The Javascript allows for the button/ button scroll functionality. 
I did remove some of the buttons and functionality that was on the original template.
# Simple WebApp Instructions <h2>
The webapp I created is a simple fraction game inspired by McMaster Outreach. </br>
The goal of the program is to enhance technical literacy in youth and use code </br>
to enhance skills in various subjects. Here, I made a game where the challenge is </br>
correctly using fractions. Here is how you play. </br>
1. Click New Weight to generate a fraction (unless you want to balance 0 which </br>
isn't very difficult)
2. Now, you select fruit of different weights to match the given fraction. If you </br>
want to get rid of any fruit, click the corresponding fruit from the top left and </br>
it will be removed. </br>
3. Once you are satisfied with your fruits, click test to see if you matched the </br>
number correctly. If correct, it should answer "You got it! Try a different weight </br>
now " and the scale will balance, otherwise, it should answer "Incorrect. Keep </br>
trying " and the scale shouldn't move. </br>
4. Now you can play and choose fractions as you please, although there are only </br>
a number of fractions so you might eventually get bored.
